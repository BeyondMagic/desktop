# Contributing

Contributions to `lovemii` are welcome! There's always an open issue with the current tracking list, which contains the proposed features for the next release you can get your hands on.

Any small changes or ideas should go in there, rather than in a separate issue. Then follows a discussion about the implementation and possible edge cases.

Before suggesting changes, please read a bit about [the principles lovemii follows](./README.md#principles).
